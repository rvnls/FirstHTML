<h1 class="Myheadings">Happy Birthday</h1>
<p>I just wanted to say that I love you very much and I want to wish you a happy happy birthday. I know that this isnt the most pretty right now or the most practical but I love you, just wait for my delayed present for you okay?</p>
<p>I'm glad I met you and I'm glad na we stayed, Parang last year lang gusto mo lagi makipag break but look at us now, medjo rough pa rin but improving naman, I just wanted to make this small message for you dahil malapit na mag 12 and wala pa akong gift hehe</p>
